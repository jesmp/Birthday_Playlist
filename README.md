üß† How It Works
You'll be prompted to enter a birth date, playlist name, and description.

The app scrapes the #1 song from Billboard for that date across each year.

Each song is searched on Spotify.

A new private playlist is created in your Spotify account and populated with the found songs.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
Some songs may not exist on Spotify ‚Äî the app will skip those with a warning.

Make sure your Spotify developer app has the correct redirect URI (https://example.com is used by default; adjust as needed).

The app creates a private playlist by default. Modify spotify_data["public"] to True if you want it public.
